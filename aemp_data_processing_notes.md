# Data Processing Notes
Census polygon data was downloaded from the US Census and IPUMS NHGIS. The data is in NAD83 CRS.

## Census 2010 Block Polygons
Note the original data CRS is USA_Contiguous_Albers_Equal_Area_Conic (http://epsg.io/102003)

Use `ogr2ogr` to select only the block groups for the 9 county bay area and reproject it to NAD83

```bash
ogr2ogr \
  -sql "select GEOID10, TRACTCE10, BLOCKCE10 from CA_block_2010 where COUNTYFP10 IN ('001', '013', '041', '055', '075', '081', '085', '095', '097')" \
  -t_srs EPSG:4269 \
  data/block_shp/census_blocks_2010_bay_area_4269.shp \
  ~/data/census/blocks_2010/CA_block_2010.shp
```

## Census 2000 Block Polygons
Note the original data CRS is USA_Contiguous_Albers_Equal_Area_Conic (http://epsg.io/102003)

Use `ogr2ogr` to select only the block groups for the 9 county bay area and reproject to NAD83 (EPSG:4269)

The column containing the FIPS column is called `STFID`, but in the 2010 shapefile it's called `GEOID10`. Let's rename it so we don't have to worry about the conflict later when running the `dotfile.py` script.

```bash
ogr2ogr \
  -sql "select STFID AS GEOID10, TRACT2000, BLOCK2000, FIPSSTCO from CA_block_2000 where FIPSSTCO IN ('06001', '06013', '06041', '06055', '06075', '06081', '06085', '06095', '06097')" \
  -t_srs EPSG:4269 \
  data/block_shp/census_blocks_2000_bay_area_4269.shp \
  ~/data/census/blocks_2000/CA_block_2000.shp
```

## Census 2016 Tract Polygons
Similar to the above processing for block polygons, extract census tracts for the bay area for land only
and reproject them to NAD83

```bash
ogr2ogr \
  -sql "select TRACTCE, GEOID from US_tract_2016 where STATEFP = '06' AND ALAND > 0 AND COUNTYFP IN ('001', '013', '041', '055', '075', '081', '085', '095', '097')" \
  -t_srs EPSG:4269 \
  data/census_tracts/census_tracts_2016_bay_area_4269.shp \
  ~/data/census_tracts/nhgis0003_shape/nhgis0003_shapefile_tl2016_us_tract_2016/US_tract_2016.shp
```

## TopoJSON Creation
To create topojson for rendering with D3

```bash
mapshaper \
  -i data/census_tracts/tracts_2016_lq_4326/tracts_2016_lq_4326.shp \
  -simplify 10% \
  -o data/census_tracts/tracts_2016_lq_4326/tracts_2016_lq_4326.json \
  force \
  format=topojson
```

## CSV Creation
A CSV can be created from any of the processed shapefiles' DBF by simply doing:

```bash
mapshaper \
  -i data/tracts_processed_lq/tracts_lq_2002/tracts_lq_2002.dbf \
  -o data/tracts_processed_lq/tracts_lq_2002/tracts_lq_2002.csv
```

## Environment Setup
For using Python Pandas and GeoPandas for data processing.

First, install Miniconda and set up a Python virtual environment with dependencies.

```bash
# install miniconda, for more see: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html
bash Miniconda2-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh

# make sure to add conda to your PATH
export PATH="/Users/chrishenrick/miniconda2/bin":$PATH

# create virtual env
conda create -n jobs_map_env python

# activate env
source activate jobs_map_env

# install pandas
conda install pandas

# install pip
conda install pip

# install shapely, geos, gdal
conda install shapely
conda install gdal

# install geopandas
conda install -c conda-forge geopandas

# to deactivate the virtual env
source deactivate
```

## Location Quotient Analysis
A _Location Quotient_ is an economic geographic analysis showing the ratio of a variable within a local area compared to its corresponding region. For this job categories analysis it means comparing the regional ratio of each of the super categories (Manufacturing and Logistics, Professional Services, Healthcare, Education, and Government, Retail, Hospitality, and Other Services) to the census tract ratio. So for example if a census tract has a value close to 1, then it is about the same as the region while greater then the region indicates a higher concentration of that category and a number less then one means a lower concentration.

To compute the LQ for the census tracts in the SF Bay Area, I tried numerous approaches as shown in the `location_quotient_processing` scripts. One problem is that it's tricky to create a map that can be viewed at the regional level, due to the smaller geographic size of tracts in San Francisco. To highlight these tracts I calculated job density (number of total jobs divided by area) and then assigned each tract a quintile based on the density values. The top quintile of job density helps inform what areas to highlight in a map, as the LQ and change in LQ from 2002 â€“ 2015, obscures job density.
